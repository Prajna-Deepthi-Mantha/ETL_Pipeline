# ETL_Pipeline

In this project, you will go through a real-world use case from the banking sector.

Your task, essentially, would be to build a batch ETL pipeline to read transactional data from RDS, transform it and then load it into RedShift Tables, after which you will have to perform some analytical queries on the loaded data.
